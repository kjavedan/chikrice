            You can come up with countless plans with the food items you have

            <p>
              After years of dieting and trying countless dieting methods we
              found out that the main reasons for failure are not merely a
              perfect detailed meal plan or ones discipline and will power.
              Although itâ€™s necessary to be discipline enough to put in to work
              to get what you want, But still if you donâ€™t know the top reasons
              of failure when it comes to dieting you will be unaware of them;
              Therefore you will be more likely to fail as well.

            <h2>Top Reasons of failure in Diet</h2>
            <img src="./assets/box.jpg" alt="food box" />
            <h3>1. Not having a system to follow</h3>
            <p>
              When it comes to dieting <b>consistency</b> is everything and without a
              <b>system</b> to follow, you are doomed to failure. What we mean
              by a system is to have a structure for your day to rely on and to
              not make decisions constantly on the macros and the calories of
              the food you need to take. By this point almost all of us know
              that in order to <b>lose weight</b> we need to be in a
              <b>caloric deficit</b> (eat less than we need) and to
              <b>gain weight</b> we need to be in <b>caloric surplus</b>
              (eat more than we need). Thatâ€™s being said you might recall an
              experience you had to lose weight, where you didnâ€™t eat much food
              in order to lose weight. but it seems that with all of those
              torture still nothing happened. Please stick around until the end
              to learn all the tools you need to make it work this time.

            <h2>2. Unsuitable environment</h2>
            <p>
              If you see your favorite snack or sweet on the table. You might
              resist the temptation for the first time, However your will power
              get exhausted. After passing by for couple of times you will
              eventually give up to temptation and eat that snack or sweet. If
              you did it once itâ€™s more likely to happen again. A snack leads to
              a sweet and a sweet leads to another thing. At the end you see
              yourself back to your old bad habits. When it comes to dieting we
              need to imagine our will power as limited resources that each time
              we use it we lose a bit of it until we are left with no defense in
              front of our temptation. We will teach you how to face this
              problem in our <b>FoodBox</b> Method to overcome these common
              challenges.

            <h2>What is the FoodBox method?</h2>
            <p>
              <b>FoodBox</b> is a method we use to make sure that we will never go off track in our diet. <b>FoodBox</b> and <b>sprint</b> main focuses is to minimize the use of your will power and decision making in your daily eating habits. You can imagine it as a home kitchen <b>store</b> where you can eat anything from it at any time in the way you like, with keeping one rule in your mind. The <b>store</b> Should last for 1 <b>sprint</b> (3 days) and you can fill your <b>store</b> again and repeat the process.
You will see the word <b>sprint</b> comes a lot with <b>FoodBox</b>. thatâ€™s because they work with each other to create the system. When you generate a meal plan we give you a grocery list for 1 <b>sprint</b>(3 day). All the items included in the grocery list are generated and calculated precisely base on you inputs.

            <h2>How Foodbox solve the probelm?</h2>
            <p>By structuring your day in a <b>systematic</b> way you will habitually do everything. For example, The first 2 week you will think more about how to do each step and itâ€™s totally normal because itâ€™s something new to you. However, after a while you wonâ€™t even think about the steps. In fact you wonâ€™t even need to weight your food because you will habitually know what is good and how much is enough for you in order to get results. That is the secret, make it as easy as possible to follow the diet and be consistent with it for couple of month and see the power of <b><b>consistency</b></b>. From long experience we have learned that this way worked much better than the traditional way of counting macros every day. <b>Why</b>? Can you run with your full speed for several hours? Obviously no. Diet is the same itâ€™s not a 100 meter race itâ€™s a marathon where you need to know how to preserve your energy until the finish line. FoodBox try's to put you on the right track and leave you there to enjoy the ride yourself. When you go to buy the first grocery list you get the idea of what good food is and how much you need. Then when you prepare the food for the first time(not easy at all be ready for the <b>frustration</b>) you learn how meal preparation is been done. Finally when you eat the food you cooked you feel the difference in your mood and performance. Thatâ€™s it now you changed your path. have to stick to it until you donâ€™t even think of it as Ohh itâ€™s so difficult you just do it and enjoy the benefits. Happy ride ðŸ˜Š.  </p>

            <h2>What is the difference between the <b>FoodBox</b> and regular meal plan?</h2>
            <p>Unlike the traditional meal plan where it tells you exactly (what, how much and when) to eat it every day, <b>FoodBox</b> doesnâ€™t strict you to the details. In fact it gives you the full ability to eat as you like when you like. <b>FoodBox</b> look at the diet in the bigger picture which is 1 <b>sprint</b>. By monitoring your resources in 3 days FoodBox make sure that you will stay on track and in the same time you will be as flexible as possible.</p>
